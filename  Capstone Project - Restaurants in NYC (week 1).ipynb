We are also particularly interested in **areas with no Chinese restaurants in vicinity**. We would also prefer locations **as close to city center as possible**, assuming that first two conditions are met.\n",

    "Our problem is clearly a clustering problem. We will therefore rely on a clustering model to solve it. Clustering models are numerous, with the two most popular being K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering.\n",
    "Fortunately, most clustering algorithms are already implemented in open source libraries for the language we will use (Python), therefore we wonâ€™t have to do much coding. The most critical and the most tedious part of this project, as with most data science projects, will be to collect and clean the data."
